The South has witnessed countless cunning men rise to power and seize the throne, yet never a woman. She is neither  your blood, nor the Mudhaliyar’s. She is neither your daughter, nor the first born. The Mudhaliyar was wrong is choosing her, she has to be cast out. The man was tall with all kind of facial hair a man could possible have to be intimidating, and yet the widowed lordess seems to not disagree.
For for too long she has deceived her father, proclaimed for the crown, but not now. The folks have already taken her side, we must act quick and make my eldest the next Mudhaliyar.
Will your son accept ? The righteous ? He won’t we always have. Making him take the thrown is not what we should focus now, but rather make his sister not come for the throne. The [] and [] families will be the first ones to support her claim and will offer their sons to her in exchange for their support. And the all noble [] would stand with her too. His prominence and his rise in his power of influence would start to sway other families too. We should proclaim the throne to your son before the families gather or at least before your son comes back.
She has sent her brother away to receive the estranged one while she is getting along with all nobles families churning her venom of grabbing the throne. I’ll tell you again you and you alone have the right to choose the next heir not the nobles. If the nobles resist that will be an act of treachery, and if she still doesn’t refute her claim for her brother, she must be come to an end or in prison – your judgment. What if my son never agrees, then you’ll take the claim and rule. No woman has ever seized the throne your words not mine. I’ll support your claim, with me the entire [] will and Mudhaliyar’s army at my command, there’ll be no question to our claim. All only until we get your son in line, all twigs has to grow in the same direction as the trunk eventually. The quicker we grab him and make him accept the claim, the lesser the trouble. 
Where is she now ? I’ll talk to her now and let her not put any unnecessary drama tomorrow.
You think you can convince her by tonight ?
Where is she ? 
The uncle let the guard come and tell where she is
She is walking back from courtside to her chambers. She was talking with [] family who will take residence in our guest palace.
I’ll meet her in her chambers and warn her, whatever she decides to do, the throne will be my sons.
She walked down to meet her in her chambers – the chambers was empty, the guards said she has not yet arrived and allowed her inside.
Not long while after, she came in.
Greetings mother! I am sure you want to meet me and convey your preference to me before you let the court your preference tomorrow. 
Greetings daughter. I indeed came to comfort my daughter of her father’s loss, I am glad to see, my daughter already has chosen to wipe her eyes, and put forth her duties, even before the Mudhaliyar’s pyre has stopped smoking.
