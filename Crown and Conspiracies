The chamber was vast—the kind of room built not for comfort, but for power. Its vaulted ceiling soared high above, lost in shadow, supported by stone columns etched with the ancestral crests of the Mudhaliyar line. Every corner of the room was designed to remind its occupants of their place. 
“The South has seen its share of ruthless men—schemers, usurpers, warriors with blood on their hands and crowns on their heads. But never—never—a woman. She carries no rightful blood, no lineage. She is neither yours, nor his. Not truly. Just a name given, she dresses the part, plays the role, but she’s not one of us. Never was. The Mudhaliyar erred in his choice, he always has been. His mistake must be undone. She must be stripped of her claim—and cast out before rot spreads through the court.”
The man delivering these words stood tall, his presence adorned with every kind of facial hair a man might brandish to seem fierce. And yet, the widowed lady, regal and composed, did not oppose his claim.
Outside the chamber, footsteps passed, muffled by stone. The palace moved on, unaware that within its heart, war had already begun. [For the past few days noble houses of the South from all directions reached [the capital], even the [] from the North. Mostly to send their regards to Mudhaliyar’s funeral but also to see the next Mudhaliyar crowned. It is a good political decision to be present when a Mudhaliyar is crowned. Good impressions reap good rewards. The palace floods with young princesses and widowed queens whenever a Mudhaliyar got crowned. But this time, the palace was flooded with princes, Lords from all the South, warrior champions. Men of all age, from a [] prince boy who was fourteen till the older Lord of [] who was 62, all decorated themselves, all of them there for one ambition, to marry the Princess and become the next Mudhaliyar in Court.
[“For too long,” he continued, “she deceived her father, masked her ambition behind virtue. But no more. The people—fools that they are—have begun to favor her. We must act swiftly.] “My eldest”, must be named the next “Mudhaliyar”.” The widow said.
“Eight days. That’s all it took for the fire to go out of [].
He burned so bright, didn’t he, anna? So stubborn, so damn certain — even when he was wrong. Especially when he was wrong.”
(pause, breath catches slightly)
I never questioned him. Not when he marched against my father’s wishes to marry me. [] And not even when he brought her home. 
(a slow scoff, half-laugh)
Vaidehi. A child. Hair like mine, but eyes like some prophecy.[skin like…..]
He said nothing — just placed her into the nursery. And like a fool, I said nothing too. Because she was a girl. Because I trusted him. Because I thought no child — especially not a girl — could ever come between what I bore and what he built.
(voice hardens)
My sons — our sons — shared her rice, her toys, her tutors [caretakers]. They loved her like blood. Called her their blood. Even my youngest, my gentle boy… And I let it be. I told myself: She is no threat. She is a girl. She is not his own.”
(rises, paces slightly)
“But blood tells. Doesn’t it? He didn’t just raise her. He chose her. Over his own sons. Over me.”
[I never did doubt her to be his own, not even when the entire South called her a bastard. I took into my arms and tried to be her mother, but when he chose her as heir, any woman would question, is she his ? did the Mudhaliyar err for lust ? or love ? ]
“Worry not Maitri, she is not his. And [] is not her’s either. Just like how Kanchi was not Sholiyar’s”
(she turns to her brother, eyes glinting)
Do you know what it does to a woman — a queen — to be told she’s good enough to sit beside a throne, but not to shape what comes after it?
Do you know what it does to a mother to see her sons looked at with pity, while she — Vaidehi — is hailed as destiny?
(beat. quieter)
I fought him. I screamed. I asked him how he could betray me, betray us. He said nothing at first.
Then he said: “Because she is the South. And she is mine own.”

(a long pause. Her voice drops)
Then he sent my second son away. Cast him out. For what he thought was righteous action, for a crime she led my son.
And yet she — this perfect daughter of destiny — remained untouched.

The South believed in his words, continued to praise his virtues. But for a  queen, for his wife, He stopped making sense a long time ago. He who brought an orphan girl, who I still believe is of no blood significance and he name’s her his heir ? (trembling now) 
He died still believing in her. And now they say the South will obey his will. That she will be crowned Mudhaliyar today. That I, the queen of this house, will bow to a girl I did not birth. That my sons will kneel. That his virtues live on through her.



The man asked, “Will your son accept ? The righteous ? He won’t we always have. Making him take the thrown is not what we should focus now, but rather make his sister not come for the throne.
“The houses of [Name] and [Name] will be the first to align with her,” the man said, voice weighted with certainty. “They’ll offer their sons in marriage, eager to trade bloodlines for power. Even the noble House of [Name] will rally to her cause. Their young heir’s growing stature could easily tip the balance in her favor. We must act—before these families unite… or before your son returns.”
He folded his hands behind his back, then spoke more gravely. 
“She’s been… strategic in her dealings. One must admit that. All three houses have sons of marrying age— ambitious, impressionable…… young men who hunger for a future at court. And she—clever as she is—has positioned herself within their reach.”
The widow’s silence prompted him to go on.
“She has spent far too much time in their company—far more than is customary, or respectable, for a woman of noble standing. One wonders,” he said, voice lower now, edged with disapproval, “how deep her alliances truly run. Whispers abound… Who knows how far she may have gone to secure their loyalty?”
Her grief gave no shield to her rage—she turned, eyes blazing.
“Mansik!”, she snapped, "Vaidehi is the Mudhaliyar’s daughter—witty, perhaps, even willful—but not a whore. To slander her is to dishonor the Mudhaliyar himself. Choose your words with care, brother. Not in my chambers. Not in his palace."
He let the words hang, heavy with implication.
“My dear Maitri, pardon my words. Seduced by her charm, flattered by her wit—perhaps by more than just words—they stand ready to declare for her. Whatever promises were whispered, whatever favors exchanged, the outcome is undeniable: she has them to her cause. And now, they’ll fight for her claim as if it were their own.”
The widow turned away, walking slowly to the window, her gaze cast into the distance.
“That may be so,” she said quietly, “but I will not slander my daughter to preserve my son. She plays the game… but so shall we.”

He continued, “She has sent her brother away to receive the estranged one while she is getting along with all nobles families churning her venom of grabbing the throne. I’ll tell you again you and you alone have the right to choose the next heir not the nobles. If the nobles resist that will be an act of treachery, and if she still doesn’t refute her claim for her brother, she must be come to an end or in prison – your judgment. 
The widow asked, “What if my son never agrees?” The man replied, “then you’ll take the claim and rule.” She argued, “No woman has ever seized the throne your words not mine.” The man replied, “I’ll support your claim, with me the entire [] will and Mudhaliyar’s army at my command, there’ll be no question to our claim. All only until we get your son in line, all twigs has to grow in the same direction as the trunk eventually. The quicker we grab him and make him accept the claim, the lesser the trouble.” 
She asked, “Where is she now ? I’ll talk to her now and let her not put any unnecessary drama tomorrow.”
You think you can convince her by tonight ?
Where is she ? 
The uncle let the guard come and tell where she is
She is walking back from courtside to her chambers. She was talking with [] family who will take residence in our guest palace.
I’ll meet her in her chambers and warn her, whatever she decides to do, the throne will be my sons.
She walked down to meet her in her chambers – the chambers was empty, the guards said she has not yet arrived and allowed her inside.
Not long while after, she came in.
Greetings mother! I am sure you want to meet me and convey your preference to me before you let the court your preference tomorrow. 
Greetings daughter. I indeed came to comfort my daughter of her father’s loss, I am glad to see, my daughter already has chosen to wipe her eyes, and put forth her duties, even before the Mudhaliyar’s pyre has stopped smoking.
