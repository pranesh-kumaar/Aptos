The chamber was vast—the kind of room built not for comfort, but for power. Its vaulted ceiling soared high above, lost in shadow, supported by stone columns etched with the ancestral crests of the Mudhaliyar line. Every corner of the room was designed to remind its occupants of their place.
The scent of sandalwood from the candles lingered, clinging to the stone walls. The late Mudhaliyar’s armor still rested atop its ceremonial stand — breastplate polished, [the family crest] glinting faintly in the firelight, as though he might walk in and wear it again. 
The Queen stood near the window, eyes distant. [Her mourning silks barely moved in the breeze, but her spine remained rigid, as if bracing against something unseen.]
Behind her, footsteps echoed with the deliberateness of someone who had waited long enough to stay silent. The man stopped just short of the dais, his voice low but edged with steel.
“The South has seen its share of ruthless men,” he said, eyes scanning the room like a judge inspecting a throne. “Schemers. Usurpers. Warriors with blood on their hands and crowns on their heads. But never — never — a woman.”
The Queen turned slightly, not fully, as if his presence alone were enough to hear but not to meet.
“Your daughter, carries no rightful blood. No lineage. She is neither yours, nor his. Not truly. Just a name he gave her. She dresses the part. Plays the role. But she’s not one of us. Never was.”
He walked closer, lowering his voice, but making it all the more cutting.
“The Mudhaliyar—he erred in his choice. As he so often did, from a dangerous faith in his own judgement. His mistake must not become the South’s. She must be stripped of her claim before the rot spreads through the court.”
He gestured vaguely toward the ancestral crests looming above them. “This room was not built to honor faith or virtue, sister. It was built to honor blood… for legacy. And you know as well as I do — hers does not belong here.”
The man delivering these words stood tall, his presence adorned with every kind of facial hair a man might brandish to seem fierce. And yet, the widowed lady, regal and composed, did not oppose his claim.
Outside the chamber, footsteps passed, muffled by stone. The palace moved on, unaware that within its heart, war had already begun. 
For eight days, the Mudhaliyar’s funeral pyre burned — as tradition demanded — its smoke rising high above the capital like a banner of mourning. It was a signal to the South that a chapter had ended, and a new one waited to be written.
And so, from every corner of the South, noble houses arrived in the old capital. Some even crossed the old borders from the North, cloaked in diplomacy and curiosity. Officially, they came to bow before the ashes and pay respects. But truly, they came to see who would rise from the ashes. A Mudhaliyar's coronation was never just about succession — it was about alignment, legacy, and opportunity. And being present meant being remembered. Good impressions, in the South, often reaped great rewards.
Tradition says the palace fills with young princesses and widowed queens whenever a Mudhaliyar is crowned — women who seek power by proximity. But not this time. This time, the palace brimmed with ambition in armor. Princes, Southern lords, and warrior champions flooded the halls. Men of every age — from a fourteen-year-old princeling of [X] to the sixty-two-year-old Lord of [Y] — all came draped in silks and intent. Each one carried the same hunger: to wed the princess, and through her, become the next Mudhaliyar in court.”
[“For too long,” he continued, “she deceived her father, masked her ambition behind virtue. But no more. The people—fools that they are—have begun to favor her. We must act swiftly.] 
“Your eldest”, must be named the next “Mudhaliyar” Maitri… not her.” [the man said after getting no reply from her sister.]
“Eight days. That’s all the fire burned. Arcaud no longer mourns, it watches, it waits. And me? I haven’t wept. Not properly. Not yet.”, she teared up a little.
“The pyre and him burned so bright, didn’t they, brother? And I—I haven’t even figured out how to mourn him. He was so stubborn, so damn certain — even when he was wrong. Especially when he was wrong.” She took a pause, catching her breath slightly. “I never questioned him. Not when he marched against my father’s wishes to marry me. Not when he went to war with the Sholiyar. And not even when he brought her home.”
She let out a slow scoff, with a half-laugh, “Vaidehi. A child. Hair like mine, and eyes that always saw too much... but that skin — too fair,— far too pale for the Southern soil."
Her eyes found her brother’s, steel-cold and unblinking, and she continued, “He said nothing — just placed her into the nursery. And like a fool, I said nothing too. Because she was a girl. Because I trusted him. Because I thought no child — especially not a girl — could ever come between what I bore and what he built.”
[Her voice hardens, “My sons — our sons — ate beside her, played beside her, learned beside her. They loved her as if she were born of me. She was never left out — they called her their own. Even my youngest, my gentle boy… And I let it be.] 
She paced slowly, voice rising with each word, as if pushing back against years of silence. “I told myself: She is no threat. She is a girl. She is not his own. But the signs were always there… weren’t they? He didn’t just raise her. He chose her. Over his own sons. Over me. And I began to question everything I had been certain of.”
[She is not his sister, we all can be sure of that.]
“I never doubted she wasn’t his. Not even when the whole South spat her a ‘bastard.’ I held her in my arms. I tried — truly — to be her mother…. But when he named her heir… tell me, [] — what woman wouldn’t wonder, if she was his? 
“Did the Mudhaliyar stray, then? Not just in duty — but in flesh? For lust… or for love? Was she born of a night I was never told about, a woman I never met? Was I ever truly his queen — or just the silence he needed while he planted his legacy elsewhere?”
“Worry not Maitri, she is not his. And Arcaud will not be her’s either. Just like how Kanchi was not Sholiyar’s”, [] said, his words cold, carried no emotions.
She turns to her brother, eyes glinting, “I fought him. I screamed. I asked him how he could betray me, betray us. He said nothing at first. Then he said: “Because she is the South.” And now they say the South will obey his will. That she will be crowned Mudhaliyar. That I, the queen of this house, will bow to a girl I did not birth. That my sons will kneel. That his virtues live on through her.”


[Nothing of that sort will come true if your eldest takes the throne. Vasudev should take the crown, it’s his blood right.”, her brother said. 
“But will he brother ?”, maitri replied.
Your son, He is just not brave enough to face the court. Who throws away a blood right ? Too coward to fight for it, to play the game to get it., the brother replied.
Don’t mistake his righteousness for cowardness, brother. – Maitri says]

[The man asked, “Will your son accept ? The righteous ? He won’t we always have. Making him take the thrown is not what we should focus now, but rather make his sister not come for the throne.]
“The houses of [Name] and [Name] will be the first to align with her,” the man said, voice weighted with certainty. “They’ll offer their sons in marriage, eager to trade bloodlines for power. Even the noble House of [Name] will rally to her cause. Their young heir’s growing stature could easily tip the balance in her favor. We must act—before these families unite… or before your son returns.”
He folded his hands behind his back, then spoke more gravely. 
“She’s been… strategic in her dealings. One must admit that. All three houses have sons of marrying age— ambitious, impressionable…… young men who hunger for a future at court. And she—clever as she is—has positioned herself within their reach.”
The widow’s silence prompted him to go on.
“She has spent far too much time in their company—far more than is customary, or respectable, for a woman of noble standing. One wonders,” he said, voice lower now, edged with disapproval, “how deep her alliances truly run. Whispers abound… Who knows how far she may have gone to secure their loyalty?”
Her grief gave no shield to her rage—she turned, eyes blazing.
“Mansik!”, she snapped, "Vaidehi is the Mudhaliyar’s daughter—witty, perhaps, even willful—but not a whore. To slander her is to dishonor the Mudhaliyar himself. Choose your words with care, brother. Not in my chambers. Not in his palace."
He let the words hang, heavy with implication.
“My dear Maitri, pardon my words. Seduced by her charm, flattered by her wit—perhaps by more than just words—they stand ready to declare for her. Whatever promises were whispered, whatever favors exchanged, the outcome is undeniable: she has them to her cause. And now, they’ll fight for her claim as if it were their own.”
The widow turned away, walking slowly to the window, her gaze cast into the distance.
“That may be so,” she said quietly, “but I will not slander my daughter to preserve my son. She plays the game… but so shall we.”

He continued, “She has sent her brother away to receive the estranged one while she is getting along with all nobles families churning her venom of grabbing the throne. I’ll tell you again you and you alone have the right to choose the next heir not the nobles. If the nobles resist that will be an act of treachery, and if she still doesn’t refute her claim for her brother, she must be come to an end or in prison – your judgment. 
The widow asked, “What if my son never agrees?” The man replied, “then you’ll take the claim and rule.” She argued, “No woman has ever seized the throne your words not mine.” The man replied, “I’ll support your claim, with me the entire [] will and Mudhaliyar’s army at my command, there’ll be no question to our claim. All only until we get your son in line, all twigs has to grow in the same direction as the trunk eventually. The quicker we grab him and make him accept the claim, the lesser the trouble.” 
She asked, “Where is she now ? I’ll talk to her now and let her not put any unnecessary drama tomorrow.”
You think you can convince her by tonight ?
Where is she ? 
The uncle let the guard come and tell where she is
She is walking back from courtside to her chambers. She was talking with [] family who will take residence in our guest palace.
I’ll meet her in her chambers and warn her, whatever she decides to do, the throne will be my sons.
She walked down to meet her in her chambers – the chambers was empty, the guards said she has not yet arrived and allowed her inside.
Not long while after, she came in.
Greetings mother! I am sure you want to meet me and convey your preference to me before you let the court your preference tomorrow. 
Greetings daughter. I indeed came to comfort my daughter of her father’s loss, I am glad to see, my daughter already has chosen to wipe her eyes, and put forth her duties, even before the Mudhaliyar’s pyre has stopped smoking.

But while he convinced the South she was his blood, I was left to face their questions — about my silence, my stance, my respect… my dignity.
But he didn’t just bring her home — he declared her to the world as his own. And deep down, he and I both knew that wasn’t the truth.
Still, I said nothing. I stood beside him, because maybe… maybe there was a reason in his actions that I was never meant to understand.
But while he convinced the South she was his blood, I was left to face their questions — about my silence, my stance, my respect… my dignity.
And yet, I chose to stand by him. I buried my doubt. I buried my pride. And I wore loyalty like a crown too heavy to lift.”
But I chose to stand by him… even if it meant putting everything I was beneath everything he wanted.”

“They grew with her, laughed with her, wept with her. My boys — innocent, unguarded — gave her everything: their games, their guards, their names. My sons they have given their enough, my youngest have spent half his life in exile. today I have chosen they will not give their rights.

[The fire snuffed not spent][That’s all the time it took for the fire to drain out of Arcaude.] 
After a long pause, her voice dropped again, “Then he sent my younger son away. [Cast him out that cursed day — the one no one talks, but all remember. She stood at the center of it, for what happened that day, won’t you agree brother? She lit the match — and yet only my son was burned.”][He has lived half his life in exile]

And yet she — this perfect daughter of destiny — remained untouched.
“The South believed in his words, continued to praise his virtues. But for a queen, for his wife — his words stopped holding meaning for me. He died still believing in her.]

I’ll mourn his death after his legacy falls in the right hands.
