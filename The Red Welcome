“I have been in exile, out of the affairs of the South. Forgotten, I thought, by everyone."
The young man beside him shifted uneasily, his jaw tightening with frustration. He looked at Varadharaj, his eyes filled with conviction. "You’re hard to forget”, he said, his voice low, “A name like 'Mudhaliyar' doesn’t fade so easily. The South remembers, even when it tries to forget."
Varadharaj let out a low chuckle—not one of humor, but one that dripped with cynicism. "Mudhaliyar," he echoed, as if tasting the word. “No one’s reminded me of that name in a long time.”  His eyes narrowed as it locked onto the young man. "Say your name again, boy.” His tone was casual, but the undercurrent of mockery was unmistakable. He already knew, but the cruelty of making the boy say it tasted too sweet to resist.
The young man hesitated, confusion furrowing his brow. “Ilyas Mugu.” The answer was careful, pride barely concealed behind the forced calm. “Four years serving your brother as a ward under Mathyasa’s Right of Passage.” 
Varadharaj raised an eyebrow, a wry smile tugging at his lips. "A ward of mine own brother? Vasudev? “Lord Vasudev”, he calls himself now?" He let out a low chuckle, his amusement barely veiled. “How has my Lord Brother, treating you?”
Ilyas measured his words, “His Lordship has been….. gracious,” his words faltered, ""Hold fast to your roots," he always tells."
“Mugu,” Varadharaj repeated, letting the name roll off his tongue with deliberate slowness. His brow arched slightly in mild amusement. “Merchants of Theerg, are they not?”
Ilyas nodded, his posture tightening, as though bracing for what was to come. “Yes, indeed. Merchants.”
["I suppose I'm in good hands then, aren't I? A merchant's son, fresh off the docks, from bartering spices to bearing arms?" he paused, "Tell me, Ilyas, what’s your going rate for saving a life these days?" (Going rate for shielding an assassination)]
The words lingered, their sting undeniable, but Ilyas held his ground, his eyes fierce despite the ridicule. His lean frame spoke more of the eagerness of a boy on the cusp of manhood. Raised in the sheltered corridors of the Mugu family, he was not a soldier by any means, nor knew much of politics or war. 
His knowledge rested in the intricacies of trade routes and market bargains, yet an untamed ambition burned deep within his chest. A dreamer by nature, Ilyas looked upon the road ahead with eager eyes, filled with the young hope that he might forge his own path and leave a mark upon the world. 
Though confused, mustering his courage, he answered, “We Mugu are more than just traders,” he began, his voice steady, though a flicker of heat sparked beneath the surface. “Merchants we may be—”
A third voice cut him off before he could finish, the man across the table speaking with a soft but firm authority. “Varadha...Leave the young man be.” It was Raki Garu, his tone was weathered, much like his appearance—deep-set eyes beneath a furrowed brow, framed by a thin layer of silver hair that had seen more battles than his words let on. 
“His father’s name carries weight in the markets of Theerg, and that name is not without power. They have ways of moving things that soldiers cannot.” Garu paused “As for me—I am the blade your brother trusts to keep you breathing.”
Varadharaj glanced at Garu, his expression barely shifting—a flicker of recognition, a hint of disdain, but mostly disinterest. The years had not been kind to what remained between them; it had eroded into something brittle, a husk of old familiarity.
“I see you’ve grown more handsome with those scars, Garu" Varadharaj's voice carried a thin veneer of mockery, a smirk playing at his lips.
Garu gave a faint smile, more a reflex than a response. He looked away, letting his eyes settle on the tavern fire. "If it bothers you so much, maybe stop looking," he replied, his voice carrying just enough weight to dismiss the conversation.
Varadharaj's smirk widened, his tone dripping with an almost amused indifference. “Ah, perhaps I missed some most eventful years in the South?” He cast a fleeting glance at Ilyas, as if seeking silent confirmation.
“Yes, well,” Garu retorted, his turn curt. “Brooding amongst dusty scrolls could scarce compare. If only battles could be won reciting poetry.”
Varadharaj's eyes hardened, a flicker of something behind his stare—annoyance, perhaps—but he masked it with a smile. He tilted his head, his voice dripping with mockery as he leaned in just enough for his words to be heard. "Oh, Garu, careful now. You wouldn't want to upset a weary traveler, would you? Especially one who's already dreading what might be waiting for him down here in the South. Poor man in distress and all that."
Garu trying to decide whether there was sincerity beneath the words or just another layer of mockery. Silence stretched between them, tense and taut.
Varadharaj spoke again, “What supposed threat do I pose to anyone?” this time an edge in his voice. 
"Maybe the very threat the Mudhaliyar once posed. And thus, you are marked, as is each soul bearing your blood” Garu answered bluntly.
“Years in exile must have dulled me to not make you understand the answer I am looking for…” his voice dropped, colder now. “A threat for what? Power? Vengeance? Gold or ransom?” a wry smile playing in his lips.
"There are many who could be behind this—nobles among them," he said, his voice steady. "The Mudhaliyar may have sent you North—"
"Exiled me," Varadharaj interrupted, his words slicing the air like a knife. "My father exiled me to the North."

Garu’s face remained still, there was a flicker of understanding in his eyes. "Your father may have exiled you, but you are still his son. That name wields honor... glory to some and menace to others. Until we uncover the men responsible for Mudhaliyar's death, we cannot yet know the true purpose behind it."
Varadharaj drew a deep breath, leaned back slightly, and spoke firmly, "Perhaps seek the motive before all else, and you shall find the men responsible." Garu offered no reply.
In this pause, Ilyas cast his eyes out the window, as if to dismiss the silence, watching as the day surrendered. Outside, the light of the day was quickly fading, as a thick shroud of mist crept over the village. The tavern sat nestled in the heart of the village, its clay and brick walls weathered but sturdy, supported by thick wooden pillars. Ilyas's thoughts were restless as he glanced towards the door, half-expecting it to swing open at any moment. Where is Lord Vasudev? He should have been here by now. The uncertainty gnawed at him—had something gone awry?
Ilyas hesitated before speaking, breaking the silence that had settled between them. "What is your intent in the South, my Lord?" he asked, his voice wary.
Varadharaj leaned back in his chair, its worn frame creaking beneath him, and cast his eyes up at the wooden beams, blackened by decades of smoke and ash. The tavern's thatched roof, worn by years of rains and southern winds, sagged in places, pressed down on the room, trapping the conversations and secrets within.
Varadharaj gave a dry chuckle, his eyes still fixed on the sagging roof. "Intent?  ... Perhaps my intent is merely to steer clear of troubles,” his eyes narrowing with a glimmer of mischief, “Or perhaps, it's to cause a bit of it.” He glanced at Ilyas, his smile wry. "Or maybe, boy, it is to do something grander. We shall see." He gave Ilyas a half-hearted wink, leaving the young man guessing whether he meant it.
Varadha’s eyes wandered, drawn to the murals on the walls, half-lit by the flickering flames of the brass oil lamps. Faded and worn by time, the scenes depicted stories older than any kingdom or empire. He stood up, to take a deeper look into a particular mural, where a mythical figure raises a sword above a collapsing city. He moved closer, captivated, as if the mural itself might whisper its secrets to him. 
But his thoughts danced along the tavern, Ilyas’s question lingered in his thoughts. What is my destiny in the South?... Varadharaj had no answer for it. I shall yet find one worthy of a song – this he has always believed in, he must. For now, I shall see my family, I shall see home, I shall see my sister. He paused, the smile fading as he realized something bitter. Their faces are lost to me. He remembered the coldness between him and Garu. Would I feel the same toward my own sister as well? He tried to remember what he knows of them. They may yet know who I am, in name ….. but shall they remember what I once was? Or shall they accept what I have become?
After a brief stillness, he turned towards Ilyas, “Remind me what the South remembers of me.” these were his gravest words that evening. If at all it remembers any of me – the thought slipped through his mind, tinged with a bitter humor only he could appreciate. The murals looked on, as startled as Ilyas, wondering what it was that Varadharaj sought. Ilyas own thoughts were not in place. What answer is he seeking this time? he wondered. 
At length, Garu broke his silence, as though he had bided his time for this very instant. “The North, remembers whatever makes for a good tale over cheap ale. Depends who you ask and how drunk they are. But the South... the South remembers. It has to, doesn't it? It clings to the past like a miser to his coin, unwilling to let go. That's what the Northerners say, don’t they?"
Garu's words lingered in the air, elusive. He offered no clarity—none whatsoever. The truth lay buried beneath his carefully chosen words. ”But I doubt the South speaks kindly of me.” He turned, fixing Ilyas with a pointed stare. “You’re the merchant—you know well what rumors make their rounds.”
Ilyas, clearly uncomfortable, but Garu continued, relentless. “The South knows which stories are worth keeping. The kind that sting, the kind that …..”
Varadharaj patience worn thin, he snapped at Ilyas “Speak, boy. Or have you nothing to say after all this time?” shutting Garu down.
Garu's eyes widened as Varadharaj's command echoed. He watched Ilyas squirm. It was as though they were playing some wicked game of [], and poor Ilyas had found himself the ball.
Ilyas took a deep breath, knowing there was no escape. “The South speaks of you in half-truths, Lord,” he began, voice quiet but steadying as he went on. “They remember the promise of a chosen one — or something close to it. But they also remember the exile. The… mistake.” He swallowed, daring not meet Varadharaj’s eyes, and instead fixed his gaze somewhere between Garu’s annoying smirk and the mural’s judgmental stare.
Varadharaj gave a subtle nod, his expression unreadable. “Go on,” he said, his tone almost bored. “And for all that’s sacred in Kanchi, don’t address me as ‘Lord’ again. I am no Lord.”
Ilyas cleared his throat and pushed forward. “A man condemned, you were sent away... exiled to the North, to the King who placed you among books and scrolls, and never spared you another thought ….” Ilyas answered his voice firm yet careful.
"Is that so?" each word uttered with a pause, Varadharaj responded, his eyes never leaving the murals. "What else do they murmur in the halls of Theerg when my name is uttered?"
“…a little more than a keeper of stories, they’d say, ….. yet I was taught to never scorn a man who tended to books, kept the silence of the library." Ilyas regretted letting those words escape his lips, realizing too late the bite in his words. Yet, they served their purpose—Varadharaj’s eyes, at last, broke from the murals and fell upon him.
“A little more than a keeper of stories,” he uttered each word slowly, his eyes never wavering from Mugu as he approached the table. “So, not everyone is an admirer…” he turned towards Garu, “It seems my fame does precede me Garu, though not with the sort of flattery one would hope for.”
[“My worth ends where the ink dries …?,” he murmured, yet his voice cut like steel.]
(What stories are spun about my exile to the North)
“What truly brings you to the South? “Garu questioned.
Before anyone could respond, a commotion erupts, outside—angry, hurried footsteps “Varadharaj Mudhaliyar!” came the gruff, the tone laced with the promise of violence. “Vasudev got words for you!” 
The tavern fell into a hushed stillness, every patron turning toward the doorway. At that moment, all three men rose to their feet, “Vasudev?” Varadharaj muttered. Garu’s eyes shifting from Varadharaj to the doorway. Ilyas darted nervously between them, his fingers twitching at the edge of the table as the voice outside growled again. The two men stood motionless, their expressions carved from stone, eyes fixed on the doorway. Their composed silence was more chilling for Ilyas than the threats beyond the door. Misfortune has indeed stuck Vasudev—Ilyas swallowed hard. 
“Get out here, Athreya, or we’ll drag Vasudev in by his bloody tongue and carve his damn words into your fucking skin!” the crude shout was followed by a low murmur of disbelief among the patrons of the tavern. “You… you’re the Mudhaliyar, aren’t you?” a voice stammered, “Is it true they’ve come for you?” another asked.
Varadharaj remained silent, his eyes locked on the door. Ilyas could feel the weight of the moment bearing down on him as he moved closer to Garu, his hand brushing the hilt of his dagger. I am no fighter. 
Garu started moving closer to the window, “Mask your face,” he commanded with his hand, as he took a glance outside. “Too many.” Garu proclaimed. The three stepped closer to the doorway. Ilyas’s mind a whirlwind of fear and confusion. Should Varadharaj yield himself, it would spell their doom—his, Vasudev’s, and perhaps Garu’s alike. Does Varadharaj wield any skill with blade or fist? Does he carry so much as a dagger beneath his cloak? Desperation tightened in his chest, and a single thought echoed like a prayer: If we are to survive this, it shall be by Garu’s will. May the whispers guide his hand right.
“Come out, Athreya, before we gut your brother!” A heavy thud punctuated the threat, followed by a sharp, pained grunt. “Ugh!”
Illyas’s hand is trembling trying to hold the dagger. “Sheath your fucking blade”- Garu commanded him, pushing past him toward the doorway, “and stay here.” Both men strode outside—Varadharaj on the left, Garu at his right. Both faces covered with a cloth mask. They halted at the edge of the tavern’s platform, instinctively claiming the slight elevation as a defensive position. Ilyas moved to the window, heart pounding as he peered outside.
The brightness outside took him by surprise; it was as though the day itself refused to fade. The sun lingered, casting long shadows that stretched toward the tavern, while everything inside remained shrouded in darkness. Ilyas squinted, his eyes needing a moment to readjust to the light.
Before them, Vasudev knelt, his face battered and bloodied, one eye swollen to a deep, angry purple. The sight sent a stab of pain through Ilyas’s chest, but Varadharaj held his composure. Maybe there was still a way to talk their way out of this—Ilyas thought. 
A glint of steel pressed against his brother’s throat, held by the brute who had called him out, his grin twisted and vicious. Two other men were held at knifepoint by the brute’s henchmen—one kneeling beside Vasudev, his head bowed in exhaustion, and another standing to his right, a blade pressed firmly against his throat. In similar fashion all men have covered their faces.
Garu’s hand hovered near his sword, muscles taut, though he held back from drawing it. The mist hung thick around them, gliding in the light of the early evening. Some would say it was as bright an evening as it could ever be—a deceptive brightness. 
The wet mud road, scattered with waterlogged potholes, squelched under the shuffle of boots—restless, waiting for the clash that seemed inevitable. Ilyas’s breath hitched. His eyes flitted from Vasudev to Varadharaj. He prayed for words—for anything that could end this without bloodshed.
“Athreya, eh?” the brute sneered, “We heard the South’s golden boy finally came back. Didn’t think ye be hiding like a scared pup, though. Ye as well as yer brother ….. ”
“Forgive me, for my ignorance,” Varadharaj said slowly, his voice edged with false humility cutting the brute’s voice. "Might you enlighten me as to which esteemed loudmouth has taken such an interest in me and my brother?". Varadharaj retorted.
Garu remained motionless, while Ilyas stood stunned. A truly venomous wit. Yet Varadharaj’s demeanor held him check. “Come now…..a man bold enough as you, shall not shy introducing himself.”
The brute regained his composure, a sneer curling across his face. "Name ain't important," he growled, his voice rough and broken. "Ye think ye smart, eh? Don’t need no name or place fer the likes o' you to know who we are," he spat, his words rough and broken. "Ye keep flappin' that fancy mouth of yers, and I'll be spillin' more than just words." He pressed the knife harder against Vasudev's neck, drawing a thin line of blood, a warning glimmer in his eyes.
Varadharaj's eyes widened as he saw blood trickle down his brother's neck, fear tightening its grip on his chest. One wrong word could cost his brother's life. After years apart, seeing his brother’s helpless face made Varadharaj's heart clench. He couldn’t afford to lose him—not like this.
The brute's voice broke through his thoughts, harsh and commanding. "On yer knees. Surrender now."
Varadharaj interrupted, "What drives a man like you? Gold? Glory? Or is it something else” his tone firm. “There may yet be a way for you to claim what you seek. Speak plainly—what is it you truly desire? How might we bring this quarrel to its end?” his face still clueless as in what might be the best course of action.
The brute frowned, his eyes narrowing. “Ain't no point in asking me fancy questions. I do what I need to survive. That's the way of the world.”
"That's right," Varadharaj nodded hesitantly, as if agreeing to placate the brute.
The brute's sneer widened, his voice dropping to an icy growl. "Get over here, nice, and slow, hands up where I can see 'em. One wrong step, and I'll gut yer brother right in front of ye—paint the ground red with his blood. I promise ye, it'll be the last thing ye ever witness."
Garu interrupted now, “You are making a grave mistake, you have no idea whose territory you're in. This is Mudhaliyar land, and that man is a Mudhaliyar." He took a step forward, his posture now almost daring. “Whoever has promised you gold have failed to mention the consequences that come with crossing us.” Garu took another stepped and the knife tightened around Vasudev’s throat. Garu’s hands already up in the air, a gesture of uneasy surrender. There seem to be no other option.
With Garu’s hands raised in surrender, the brute’s eyes locked onto Varadharaj, "Take off yer mask," taut with menace. The knife pressed harder against his brother’s neck, a dangerous threat that needed no further explanation.
“It will be lucky for you, if you were more greedy than proud.” Varadharaj said, tossing a heavy sack of coins at the brute’s feet. “Here lies hundred gold lions, not the stags that [you squabble over] in the South. Hundred pieces of gold lions from the North, they buy almost twice when you spend it in the South. [Release my brother, and each of your men will leave with the same fortune.]”
“Gold spends the same, no matter whose blood pays for it…. Milk no goat ye shall butcher for meat. Take off yer mask or I’ll gut you both and be done with it.”, his blade pressed harder, Varadharaj has no other option.
His left hand rose, unwrapping the cloth from his face slowly. “I am a harmless man. Stripped off my titles, before my exile. That means no name, no station, no letters. Just another man. Just another man who served the King’s counsel as…”, his face now fully revealed, “….a mere keeper of books.”
In an instant, his other hand moved like lightning, slipped under his belt to unearth the hidden pistol. His eyes glinted with cold fury. There was no hesitation. Three shots rang out, all at the same time, echoing like a thunder.
The bullet found its mark cleanly, striking the brute in the center of his forehead. His sneer evaporated, replaced by a moment of shock before his body crumpled to the ground, lifeless.
The second man, who barely had time to register what was happening. The bullet pierced through his skull, a grotesque red mist erupting as his eyes widened in disbelief. He fell, his body collapsing into an awkward heap.
The third man tried to react, but he was too slow. The shot was precise, and the man was dead before he hit the ground, his body slumping beside the others.
The sudden brutality of it all left a chilling silence. None of them—Vasudev, Ilyas, or Garu—had time to react, the shock of the violence still paralyzing them. Before they could even begin to process what had happened, Varadharaj was already moving. With his pistol slid back into his belt, he unsheathed his blade—the sword, as soon as it touched the light, any one could recognize its origin. A weapon unmistakable in its lineage, he charged at the remaining men.
Within the tavern’s shadowed corners, Ilyas remained frozen, his thoughts slower than his pounding heart. Amidst the swirling chaos, a singular, chilling question took hold in his mind: Is that Ice he wields?
The first of the remaining brutes barely had time to lift his weapon before Varadharaj's blade sliced through him, the force of the blow cleaving him down to the bone. Blood sprayed across the ground, and Varadharaj moved on, his eyes empty of any mercy. The next man tried to swing at him, but Varadharaj ducked, using his momentum to drive the sword upwards into the man's gut, twisting viciously before pulling it free.
One by one, the remaining men fell, each death more gruesome than the last. Every strike deliberate, he fought like a man possessed; each blow struck with fury.
The final man stumbled backward, tripping over the bodies of his fallen comrades. Varadharaj advanced on him, his eyes devoid of pity. He swung the blade once more, slicing through flesh and bone. The man's scream died in his throat as he crumpled to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.
When it was over, Varadharaj stood among the bodies of all [twelve men], his chest heaving, his hands-stained red. He was covered in blood—the blood of the brutes. He turned, his eyes meeting Vasudev's, Ilyas', and Garu's. The silence was deafening, the air thick with the metal tang of blood. The earth squelched as he moved, each step soaking of blood. [The villagers still in shock of the sight that happened in their little town.]
He wiped the blood from his sword onto the sleeve of his jacket. The blade, forged to a translucent perfection, caught the dim light, and shimmered like a shard of frozen glass. He raised it before his eyes, in a chilling voice he uttered, “Ayushman Bhava.”
As he sheathed his sword, he uttered in a chilling voice, “What they bury in the South shall rise in the North. Go Forth and tell the South: The Keeper has returned.”
Ilyas watched him go, with a chill of realization, The Keeper has returned — and the Keeper of Stories, guard’s darker tales than we ever knew.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Garu leaned forward, “You return after all these years, after your father cast you out, and not a soul thought you'd dare set foot here again. …. But… here… you ...are…, like a vulture…. drawn to a feast. You mean to stay, don't you? So, what’s next for you? What are you truly after?”
What brings you to the South? 
“Book keeping is highly paid Garu, I will find myself a good library for myself to work and slave away. The one in the capital [name], Samrddhi or I may perhaps go to Kanchi, good money you know.
He turned back towards Mugu, “My worth ends where the ink dries … is that so? his voice cut like steel.
“Is that what you’d have us believe, Varadha?” Garu cut the tension. “…that you were just a steward in a sanctum. I clung to their tales, until your presence told me more than they ever could. All shit and lies.”
The tavern fell into a hushed stillness, every patron turning toward the open doorway. At that moment, all three men rose to their feet, “Vasudev?” Varadhan muttered, voice edged with a dark suspicion. Garu’s eyes narrowed, shifting from Varadharaj to the doorway. Ilyas darted nervously between them, his fingers twitching at the edge of the table as the voice outside growled again. The two men stood motionless, their expressions carved from stone, eyes fixed on the doorway. Their composed silence was more chilling for Ilyas than the threats beyond the door.
“Get out here, Athreya, or we’ll drag Vasudev in by his bloody tongue and carve his damn words into your fucking skin!” the crude shout was followed by a low murmur of disbelief among the patrons of the tavern. “You… you’re the Mudhaliyar, aren’t you?” a voice stammered, “Is it true they’ve come for you?” another asks.
Varadharaj stepped into the center of the tavern, the firelight catching on the rich fabric of his long coat. His attire very distinct, one from the North. [

]

“Come out, Athreya, before we gut your brother!” A heavy thud punctuated the threat, followed by a sharp, pained grunt. “Ugh!”
"Get out here, Mudhaliyar scum, we ain't got all day! When we're done with you, that bastard whore of your sister's next. We hear she's got that milk-white skin, and my men are itching to make her scream.”
The tavern door crashed open with a thud, and the three men strode outside—Varadharaj at the center, Garu at his right. All three faces covered with a cloth mask. They halted at the edge of the tavern’s platform, instinctively claiming the slight elevation as a defensive position. Garu’s hand hovered near his sword, muscles taut, though he held back from drawing it. The mist hung thick around them, shifting in the pale light of the early evening. Some would say that evening was as bright as it could ever be. The wet mud road, scattered with waterlogged potholes, squelched under the shuffle of boots—restless, waiting for the clash that seemed inevitable.
Before them, Vasudev knelt, his face battered and bloodied, one eye swollen to a deep, angry purple. The sight sent a stab of pain through Varadharaj's chest, but he held his composure, eyes cold and scrutinizing. A glint of steel pressed against his brother’s throat, held by the brute who had called him out, his grin twisted and vicious. Two other men were held at knifepoint by the brute’s henchmen—one kneeling beside Vasudev, his head bowed in exhaustion, and another standing to his right, a blade pressed firmly against his throat. In similar fashion all men have covered their faces.
Down the road to Varadharaj’s left, a handful of Mudhaliyar’s men knelt in the mud, their faces bruised and bloodied. The brute’s men, smirking with cruel satisfaction, stood guard over them, their weapons glinting ominously in the muted light. Soon the air got thick with the scent of damp earth.
“Athreya, eh?” the brute sneered, “We heard the South’s golden boy finally came back. Didn’t think ye be hiding like a scared pup, though. Ye as well as yer brother ….. ”
“Forgive me, for my ignorance,” Garu said slowly, his voice edged with false humility cutting the brute’s voice. "Might you enlighten me as to which esteemed loudmouth has taken such an interest in me and my brother?"
The brute was taken aback by Garu’s response, momentarily stunned by the unexpected boldness. Even Mugu, who stood nearby, felt a pang of concern, thinking Garu may have gone too far.
Varadharaj remained still, watching as Garu put himself at risk. He wanted to shout at Garu to stop, to tell him to fall back, but he knew that would only make things worse. Garu's courage was the only thing keeping the brute distracted.
The brute eyed Garu with suspicion, his brow furrowed. "Ye? Ye is Athreya?"
Garu lifted his chin, meeting the brute's eyes without a hint of fear. “And what grand title should we address you by?” he retorted.
The brute regained his composure, a sneer curling across his face. "Name ain't important," he growled, his voice rough and broken. "Ye think ye smart, eh? Don’t need no name or place fer the likes o' you to know who we are," he spat, his words rough and broken. "Ye keep flappin' that fancy mouth of yers, and I'll be spillin' more than just words." He pressed the knife harder against Vasudev's neck, drawing a thin line of blood, a warning glimmer in his eyes.
Varadharaj's eyes widened for a moment as he saw the blood trickle down his brother's neck. Fear tightened its grip on his chest, a cold reminder of the danger they were truly in. Garu had to be careful—one wrong word could cost his brother's life. After so many years, he found himself in front of his brother. It was a face he had not seen in so long, a face etched with both strength and the passage of time. Seeing his brother like this, helpless, made Varadharaj's heart clench. He couldn't afford to lose him—not like this. 
The brute's voice broke through his thoughts, harsh and commanding. "On yer knees. Surrender now."
Garu interrupted, "What drives a man like you? Gold? Glory? Blood? Or just the thrill of being cruel?" his face still clueless as in what might be the best course of action, his hands already up in the air.
The brute frowned, his eyes narrowing. "Ain't no point in asking me fancy questions. I do what I need to survive. That's the way of the world."
Garu swallowed, "That's right," he said, nodding hesitantly, as if agreeing to placate the brute.
The brute's sneer widened, his voice dropping to an icy growl. "Get over here, nice, and slow, hands up where I can see 'em. One wrong step, and I'll gut yer brother right in front of ye—paint the ground red with his blood. I promise ye, it'll be the last thing ye ever witness."
Garu continued, “You are making a grave mistake, you have no idea whose territory you're in. This is Mudhaliyar land, and that man is a Mudhaliyar." He took a step forward, his posture now almost daring. “Whoever has promised you gold have failed to mention the consequences involved.” Garu took another stepped and the knife tightened around Vasudev’s throat. Garu’s eyes his eyes darting between the brute and Varadharaj, searching for some sign of what to do next.
The brute's eyes narrowed, suspicion clouding his features. "Take off yer mask," he demanded, his voice dripping with distrust. The knife pressed harder against Vasudev's neck, a dangerous threat that needed no further explanation.
"I am harmless," he tried to reason, but the brute was not swayed. The pressure of the blade increased, and Garu knew he had no choice. Slowly, he reached up and began to unravel the cloth from his face.
“My father exiled me to the North, where I served under the King’s counsel as …” Garu paused as the last piece of cloth fell, Varadharaj took a deep breath, his eyes flicked from the brute to Vasudev, then back again, Garu’s face now fully revealed, “a mere keeper of books.”
In an instant, Varadharaj's hand moved like lightning, darting beneath his belt to unearth the hidden pistol. His eyes glinted with cold fury. There was no hesitation. Three shots rang out, all at the same time, echoing like a thunder.
The bullet found its mark cleanly, striking the brute in the center of his forehead. His sneer evaporated, replaced by a moment of shock before his body crumpled to the ground, lifeless.

The third man tried to react, but he was too slow. The shot was precise, and the man was dead before he hit the ground, his body slumping beside the others.
The sudden brutality of it all left a chilling silence. None of them—Vasudev, Ilyas, or Garu—had time to react, the shock of the violence still paralyzing them. Before they could even begin to process what had happened, Varadharaj was already moving, his pistol discarded back in his pocket, as he drew his sword and charged at the remaining men.
The first of the remaining brutes barely had time to lift his weapon before Varadharaj's blade sliced through him, the force of the blow cleaving him down to the bone. Blood sprayed across the ground, and Varadharaj moved on, his eyes empty of any mercy. The next man tried to swing at him, but Varadharaj ducked, using his momentum to drive the sword upwards into the man's gut, twisting viciously before pulling it free.
One by one, the remaining men fell, each death more gruesome than the last. Varadharaj moved with a cold, calculated efficiency, his body covered in the blood of his enemies. He fought like a man possessed, his every movement precise, deliberate, and filled with an unrelenting fury.
The final man stumbled backward, tripping over the bodies of his fallen comrades. Varadharaj advanced on him, his eyes devoid of pity. He swung his sword once more, the blade slicing through flesh and bone. The man's scream died in his throat as he crumpled to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.
When it was over, Varadharaj stood among the bodies of all twelve men, his chest heaving, his hands-stained red. He was covered in blood—not his own. He turned, his eyes meeting Vasudev's, Ilyas', and Garu's. The silence was deafening, the air thick with the metal tang of blood. The earth squelched as he moved, each step soaking of blood. 
He wiped the blood from his sword onto the sleeve of his jacket. The blade, forged to a translucent perfection, caught the dim light, and shimmered like a shard of frozen glass. He raised it before his eyes, in a chilling voice he uttered, “Ayushman Bhava.”
As he sheathed his sword, he uttered in a chilling voice, “What they bury in the South shall rise in the North. Go Forth and tell the South: The Keeper has returned.”
Ilyas watched him go, with a chill of realization, The Keeper has returned — and the Keeper of Stories in fact guards darker tales than we ever knew.

Varadharaj tilted his head slightly, his lips curling into a humorless smile. "Returned? I prefer 'crawled back.' Has a nicer ring to it, don't you think?"
