Ilyas Mugu: Oaths and Obsession
The Keeper has returned — and the Keeper of Stories in fact guard’s darker tales.  
What unraveled at the tavern, it’s nothing short of reckoning. The South will speak of it, I have no doubtcMudhaliyar the younger has returned. 
Yet, tongues will wag as they always do. He’ll go by many other names, Mudhaliyar the exiled son; the spoiled heir; the book keeper— has returned.
He calls himself the Keeper now—the Keeper of Stories. And why? For one reason alone: a single question he asked, and I dared to answer. 
Varadharaj, the younger Mudhaliyar, has been a subject of interest for me for a long time. Despite working for his brother, he was rarely spoken of. The King’s letters spoke of him tending the Keep of Jema, but we’ve learned that the Keeper was never merely a bookkeeper. There are questions the South can only retort with false answers, but my answer? It was honest. And that honesty is what they remember of him: a Keeper of Stories.
Lord Vasudev, his men and I are all bound to Annaval now. The Whispers themselves seemed to show mercy that evening, sparing Vasudev. A man so noble and benevolent should not be marred by such violence again. 
The scar upon his neck, however, is a haunting reminder of what nearly came to pass. It runs jagged and cruel. When I asked how he felt about it, he replied, “It’s not the scar I mind—it’s the story it forces me to live.” 
I hesitated, unsure how to respond. I said what I had to, "A story that ends with you alive is still better than most."
"You’ll have your scars one day, Ilyas. We all do. Some you’ll wear with pride, others you’ll hide. Your real lesson lies in knowing which is which.”
I couldn’t stop myself from asking, "And this one? Which is it for you?" 
“This one will fade soon.” he replied. I understood what he meant. The scar wasn’t a mark he intended to carry for long, not because it would heal, but because he would make sure its story ended. This scar, to him, was unfinished business. The wound has healed, but its warning will remain.
The ambush was as brutal as it was clever. A caravan of merchants blocked the path with barrels, claiming their cart had toppled. When Vasudev ordered his men to assist, the barrels burst open, hurling jagged metal shards into the air. Horses reared, men cried out in pain, and chaos ensued.
In the chaos, Lord Vasudev was overpowered, bound, and dragged to the tavern. The brutes responsible—known as Shirvi's Twelve—were as infamous as they were skilled, though no one could mistake them for being clever. They had once terrorized Shirvi, until a benefactor secured their allegiance for a new purpose: capturing the Mudhaliyar brothers.
“These were the same thugs who once ran amok in Shirvi,” I heard someone mutter, “until someone with too much coin and too little taste decided they were perfect for the job of capturing the Mudhaliyar brothers.” — the tents and their murmurs, Oh I would miss them when my Passage is done. 
Their cunning didn’t come from their own minds but from the resources they were given—trap barrels, precise timing, detailed information about Lord Vasudev’s movements, and a designated place to strike. “Their cunning was borrowed, not bred,” Garu once quipped. Whoever orchestrated this betrayal clearly knew Lord Vasudev’s routines well. It wasn’t just a random attack; it was a carefully laid plan. 
I am not one to linger outside tents, eavesdropping on arguments better left unheard, but the rising tempers and biting words between the two brothers are impossible to ignore. On that matter Varadharaj was overheard remarking at Vasudev, “What a delightful circle of trust you keep.” For which Vasudev apparently have responded, “We owe that much to your presence, for silencing all loose ends.”
But oh, shall not forget Lord Vasudev’s foresight. He always does. It’s maddening, honestly. He knew there could be trouble—hence why he sent me and Garu off to the Merchant’s Road to await his brother’s arrival. He likely already has a strong suspicion of who orchestrated this. After all, warnings are never given without reason, and Lord Vasudev always plays the long game.
While my Lord might fume at the indignity of being ensnared in such a trap, our new guest, Varadharaj, has proven to be no less vexing in his own right. Though he carries himself a savior, his sharp tongue and opinions have sparked more than a few quarrels with Lord Vasudev.  Some claim to have heard Varadharaj say, “Couldn’t outwit a barrel”, inside Vasudev’s tent. A fair jab, I’d say, between brothers.
Tensions rise whenever they visit each other’s tent. Yet, for all his demeanor, Varadharaj did save Lord Vasudev—a fact not lost on the camp, where respect for my Lord remains unwavering. While his brother’s presence is far from welcome. 
Among all bickering between the brothers, there was one act of his brother that Lord Vasudev couldn’t forgive. Anyone in these lands would understand the weight of it.
Firearms.
They are the most coveted weapon and the most damning. Possessing one is a death sentence, let alone wielding it in combat. Such an act is deemed treacherous—a coward’s choice—and punished with the most gruesome of deaths. Tales of executions for mere possession are recited across every border. Even the King himself decreed their use a crime against the Crown and the Gods alike. 
Varadharaj might have used in combat to save his brother, yet the act of using one remains a mark of cowardice. 
"Weapons that reap lives like wheat, curse the ground they scar, and killing from such, afar, dishonors who we are." 
— these are the words of Whispers.
So, the crown acted upon it, banishing the use and possession of it. To be truthful, it weighs heavily on Vasudev, for the Mudhaliyar was slain by the pull of a firearm’s trigger. Does the King know of this? Varadharaj was serving the King under the Passage, yet how he came to possess such a weapon remains a mystery. When asked, he falters, his words delay and hesitation cloaks what he cannot say. 
Now, the burden of responding for his brother's actions falls heavily on Vasudev. In this land, merely possessing such a weapon is among the gravest of crimes. Whether Varadharaj will face trial for his actions remains uncertain, a question only time can answer.
What is certain, however, is the heated exchange between the brothers. This everyone in the camp was certain they heard.
“Throw that vile thing into the Scar Lake and be done with it. No good will come of you carrying such a tool of dishonor.”
“This weapon serves me well—It serves a purpose, one that is mine to decide.”
“No man of honor wields such a thing. You shame the Mudhaliyar, and his death, simply by holding it.”
“One took the life of a Mudhaliyar, and one saved a Mudhaliyar. You stand on the far shore of the river, my brother. I will not throw it away. I’ll not wield it carelessly, but neither will I abandon it. Does the manner of killing cleanse the stain of blood? Are we not all stained, in some way or another?”
“It does, one is honorable while the other is treason. Does the King know you bear this stain under his Passage? Care to explain your duties during those years?
The camp, restless as it was, might have borne witness to further quarrels, had Garu not intervened. “Clear the camp,” he ordered, “and do not return until the air is still once more.”
When we returned later, the voices had fallen silent, save for the sharp clarity of Lord Vasudev’s parting words “Do what you must, Varadha, but I shall prefer never seeing that cursed thing in your hand again.” To which, Varadharaj’s voice followed, calm “As you wish, Lord brother. I shall keep it out of sight—for now.”
What else has Varadharaj hidden beneath his composed exterior? If he holds onto that firearm, what other secrets might he clutch close to his chest? More importantly what were his duties to the King? There is an obsession in whatever he does, what for?
He was exiled, that much everyone knew. The men in the camp keep saying he wasn’t supposed to return unless his father or the King declared his exile over. But the Mudhaliyar is dead, and the King hasn’t said a word about it. So, what does that mean? Is he still an exile, or isn’t he? Once, Garu muttered something under his breath, like, “He might have to stand trial for this.” That didn’t make anything clearer, but it sure made everyone uneasy. 
If he is breaking exile, what is the punishment? Surely, should be worser than exile itself. Execution, maybe? Something worse? I don’t know and I’m not sure I want to find out. All I know is, he’s here now, walking among us like he belongs. And whether the law agrees or not, none have been brave enough to tell him otherwise. 
Amid the dramas in the camp, I’ve kept my own burden hidden. Vasudev doesn’t know, and I can’t bring myself to tell him, not yet. Letters from my father have been arriving, each one carrying a heavier message than the last. Chaos looms large across the lands after the Mudhaliyar’s death and each word in my father’s letters are soaked in fear for my safety.
“I cannot find peace knowing you are in the midst of such trouble. You have learned enough; End your Passage while you still can and return home at once.”
Yet, the thought of returning home fills me with dread. There, my future is bound to haggling over spices and silks. Four years I have walked this path, far from the comforts of Theerg. The years have been fruitful—until last week. What happened at the tavern has etched itself into my mind, a grim reminder of my inadequacies. It has laid bare a truth I cannot escape—I am no fighter.
Yet, something compels me to stay. This could be my moment, a promise to do something grander in my vasudevlife. I know the day will come when my father writes directly to Vasudev, ending any argument, I might have. Perhaps that day is already near. If even the faintest opportunity arises to stay, I will seize it. I must.
The camp was not always sullen and sulky. These are brothers, and soon they would reconcile. Tomorrow, Annaval awaited us, but tonight, tonight we gathered for what might be our last meal before the city.
Varadharaj poked the fire with a stick, "Do you remember when I broke Amma’s favorite pot?".
Vasudev raised an eyebrow. "Which time?"
The men chuckled, and Varadharaj grinned. "The one with the blue flowers.”
“Ah, you tried to pin it on me. Of course, I remember.” enough to stir everybody’s curiosity.
“I tried to blame it on your stupid cat, not you.” {build some story here. Make a joke about his cat an mock Vasudev for being a cat person}
“Stupid? That 'stupid cat' was smarter than you. She’d vanish the moment you came near because she knew you were trouble.”
(Varadharaj makes a joke about the cat and Vasudev and AMmahere)
The men erupted into laughter, and Vasudev finally cracked a smile. "Better than your 'song' about Vaidehi’s cooking. What was the line? 'A meal so bold, it could make a warrior fold'?"
The group erupted again, and I couldn’t hold back my laughter either.
Varadharaj continued, “Oh, how is my sister doing? She didn’t bother to respond to my letter. One time when we were in the Regal Progress around []. There was this noble boy—poor thing—convinced by us that Vaidehi would grant him her favor if he presented her with frogspawn disguised among flowers. We even gave it an absurdly poetic name— ‘pearls of life.’”
“I had no part in it—such mischief was beneath me, of course. But the idea was too ridiculous to resist.”
“And he actually did it!”, Varadharaj laughed, “One of those lads from the Vaidhiyar family, wasn’t he?” It was easier for him to get those vile things. Vaidehi was absolutely horrified, but far too clever to let him off easily. She convinced the lad, that gifts of such ‘great maternal significance’ were better suited for his mother, not maidens. ‘Go and gift her this,’ she said, and he scampered off, red-faced and mortified.”
The camp erupted again.
Lord Vasudev was finally feeling relaxed, he continued with another story. ““Boys from noble houses would line up to offer Vaidehi their finest jewelry, hoping to win her favor. Watching them, Varadha decided he wanted to do something equally… noble. So, naturally, he stole our mother’s jewelry to impress a street dancer.”
"Ah, but she smiled at me, didn’t she? A small price to pay for beauty." 
"Small price?, any other Lord would have snatched the necklace back, and her dignity alike. Since it was father he let the lady keep it. He said “My son has found you pleasing, you shall come to court and perform”
“Of course, while he was gracious with her, he was far less forgiving with us.”
Though he made peace with the dancer, our mother was furious.
“our father too”, “Bring him here he said.” 
‘Do you know what they call someone who does such a thing? A thief. And do you know the punishment for thieves?’ Poor Varadharaj was trembling, hiding behind Vaidehi’s skirt like a pup, clutching her hands and legs for dear life.”

“Vaidehi always had a knack for saving him. That day, she offered her own jewels to make amends for Mother’s loss.” That made father so thrilled he let us go.
[“One of the soldier comments what his sister did to him.”]


#################################################
Not to forget there were some warm moments in this camp too. Both brothers are glad to see each other after all just that the circumstances couldn’t be worse. Once when we were in circle around a camp, Varadharaj joined sharing some stories about their childhood, mocking them. And Vasudev too did share some laughs and stories. Eventually varadhraj showed off his sword ice, and how it is made off. And eventually said I am glad to see you brother, I may think what would be the one moment I would run for 7 years in exile, that would be the day my father ganteing me my hoor back, I would be too proudful, coming back home seeing all you. I was hoping I would see you at better cirmuctances in the tavern too, that we ould welcome each other warmly. Things couldn’t o more wrong but here we are alive. I should have let those buffoons take us see where they take us.
"This," Varadharaj said, his voice lowering, "is not forged like your clumsy weapons. Ice was carved from coral fossils on the eastern coast. Sharpened, not smelted. Stronger than steel, lighter than your pride, Vasudev."
“Though, between us, Vaidehi’s skirts are better armor than anything forged in the South.”
“I’ll never be like Vasu! Never! He’s good at everything, and I’m just... just Raja! Everyone says so.”
Vaidehi, all of 10 years old but already as cunning as a court advisor, tilted her head and gave him a wicked grin. “Well, who says you have to be like Vasu? Why not show him what it’s like to not be perfect for once?”
“You’ll what? Perfectly and politely tell on us?
Vaidehi closed her book, her eyes lighting up. “What if we made him... not so perfect?”
Raja perked up. “You mean, get him into trouble?”
Once upon a time, your precious Vasudev wasn’t as... let’s say, flawless as he’d have you believe.”
So the night before his big demonstration, I took some oil from the kitchens and... let’s just say his sword handle got a little extra shine.”
“The next morning,” Varadharaj continued, “there’s Vasu, standing tall in front of Father and half the court, his chest puffed out like a rooster. He raises his sword, starts his demonstration, and—” Varadharaj mimed a dramatic slip, flailing his arms. “The sword goes flying straight into the air! Lands smack in the mud at Father’s feet.”
