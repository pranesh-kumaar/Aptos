The Siege of Kanchi: Walls of Desperation by {……….} Chettiyar

Kanchi was not just any city. It was a fortress, a port, and a haven of ancient mystique. In the realm of the southern lands, Kanchi held a unique place. Its walls, towering and impregnable, were said to be imbued with magic from an era before the whispers began, crafted by powers that shaped the world in times forgotten. 
The city thrives on the breath of the sea, and the port, supple with trade. All goods must come to Kanchi, if its destiny is distant lands, from {} and even as far as {}. The trade alone brings Kanchi so much gold, in good years more gold than the Crown, much to the Crown's chagrin, I am sure. 
Though brimmed with riches, the city is perpetually parched. Drenched in gold, the city gasps for water whenever fate withholds its mercy. In lean years, we trade gold for fresh water, and in lush years, we loan gold to the Crown. Lately, though, the Crown seems to want more than just our gold— now half our army fights under the King’s command alongside the Simhasaars, with my brothers at the King’s side. This convenient arrangement left the gates of Kanchi sieged by that Mudhaliyar. Ravens flew swiftly once the siege began, carrying word to the North for the King. My brothers battling afar only to find out our home besieged in their absence. 
The city of Kanchi was not just impregnable; it had never been conquered by any outside force, or so the legends say. From within these ancient walls, we have watched countless would-be conquerors falter.  Shyoli the Second of Kochi was one such conqueror. His ambition led him to our gates, believing he could seize Kanchi's splendor for his own. Well, the gates were as far as he could reach. He was slain at our gates, his blood mingling with the dust, and his clan ended with him. They called him Shyoliyar the “Last” after that day. 
And then there was Thingol the Usurper, who, within these very walls, dared to incite brutal civil war. He was known as Thingol Chettiyar, though no one speaks of him by that name anymore. He sought glory and his name immortalized in history. He, too like Shyoli, was slain in war. His ambition, they say, was his downfall. Our family, wise but vindictive decreed that his name was never given to another. The city had a way of showing no mercy to those foolish enough to try conquering it.
Varadharaj, believes he can succeed where others have failed. But Kanchi is not just any city. Here, we have ways to deal with those who overreach, tales that might make one squirm a bit. In Kanchi, we have this delightful little practice for those who earn our utmost displeasure. The condemned are slathered in Kanchian salt, mixed with Dhara oil, and then set alight. The salt burns into the skin, seeping into every wound, and the flames blaze bright yellow, a spectacle of pain and punishment. Even while at we would catapult burning salt at the enemy. A more unpleasant way to die in battle, I cannot imagine. 

To be fair, his conquest has been undeniably successful. In a mere eighteen months, the lands of the Chettiyars have largely fallen under the indomitable shadow of Varadha. With each conquered city, his legend grew, threading through the southern realms like a dark tapestry of ambition and iron will. City after city burned, castle after castle fell. Outside he gets what he wanted an unfathomable legend, Varadharaj, The Undefeated. No one was foolish enough to think He would come for us lay siege to our city. It is a foolish act to be honest. 
The Kings return was imminent.

But Varadharaj was driven by more than mere conquest. He was driven by the prophecy and his unshaken belief in his own immortality. Seizing Kanchi would be the ultimate testament to his invincibility. Moreover, capturing the city would significantly bolster his bargaining power when facing the King. It would prove that even the mightiest bastions could fall before him, and with Kanchi under his control, he could dictate terms that favored the Mudhaliyars immensely.

Days turned into weeks, and the siege continued. Varadharaj's camp was abuzz with activity, yet the prince remained singularly focused. Every morning, he would ride along the length of Kanchi's walls, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness, any hint that the city was ready to surrender. His presence was a constant reminder to those within and without the walls that he was as relentless as the passage of time.

Whispers of his sister Vaidehi’s disapproval reached him often, yet they did nothing to sway his resolve. He was a rogue prince, a rebel with the might of half the Mudhaliyar army at his back, operating without the sanction of his family or the Mudhaliyar council. To Varadharaj, this was not rebellion but liberation—from the shackles of diplomacy, from the chains of expected subservience.

As the siege wore on, the city of Kanchi began to feel the grip of starvation. Varadharaj knew it was only a matter of time before they would have to surrender or face annihilation. He had no desire to destroy such a splendid city, but his ambition left room for nothing less than total surrender.

In his tent, lit only by the flickering light of a single lamp, Varadharaj poured over maps and reports, planning for the moment the city would fall. He imagined walking through the gates of Kanchi, not as a destroyer, but as a ruler hailed by the prophecy, vindicated by victory.

Yet, as the stars whispered of his fate, the looming question remained—would the King honor a victory so boldly won, or would the return of the Chettiyar forces change the game entirely? Varadharaj, however, was prepared to meet any challenge, for his ambition knew no bounds, and his belief in his destiny was unshakeable. In his heart, he was already the undisputed master of all he surveyed, the legendary prince who dared to tame the impregnable Kanchi.

Inside Kanchi, the situation grew dire. With their storages dwindling and despair whispering through the streets, the city's defenders watched the horizon for any sign of the returning Chettiyar army and their king. They held onto hope, the kind that flickers faintly in the darkest times.

The lore of Kanchi was as old as time itself, with legends that wove through the fabric of its stones and the hearts of its people. The walls are littered with tales of conquerors who sought its glory, only to be met with ruin.   The people of Kanchi lived in the shadow of these walls, their lives intertwined with the myths and legends of their city's origins.
The city's population was a mosaic of old and new beliefs. While the common folk waits for divine whispers in this dire time, few within Kanchi still clung to the old ways, practicing ancient rites, and offering prayers to these forgotten divinities. Yet, as the siege wore on and supplies dwindled, the faith of the city's inhabitants began to wane. The whispers that once brought comfort now carried a tinge of desperation, the prayers offered to any god, old or new, that might listen. 
It was said that the Mudhaliyar clan were the first to embrace the whispers, interpreting the celestial messages as guidance from the new Gods. Standing outside the impregnable walls of Kanchi was Varadharaj Mudhaliyar, the very man prophesied by these Gods of Whisper.
The presence of Varadharaj, outside the walls, challenged the faith within the city's walls. The defenders of Kanchi found their beliefs tested as they faced starvation and the threat of annihilation. In their darkest hours, they prayed to all gods—the ancient ones, the new divine whispers, and even search for new ones. Some even claimed to see visions in the flickering flames, a sign that the very fabric of their spiritual world was unraveling or perhaps losing their mind. Each day of the siege was a day closer to the breaking point, not only of Kanchi's defenses but of its people’s spirits. 
As Varadharaj’s forces tightened their siege, the city’s inhabitants began to see their revered walls not just as physical barriers but as symbols of their faltering faith. Each day of the siege was a day closer to the breaking point, not only of Kanchi's defenses but of its people’s spirits.

As Varadharaj approached the city, the sight of Kanchi's walls filled him with both awe and determination. These were no ordinary fortifications. Rising high into the sky, they seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly aura. The stones were said to have been laid in the era before the great cycle of time had turned, in an age when the old Gods were said to walked the earth and bestowed their boon upon the chosen few.

The walls had withstood the test of time, remaining unbreeched for over thousands of years. Generations of warriors and conquerors had stood before these walls, only to be repelled by their mystical strength. It was said that the walls of Kanchi were not merely built but conjured, a creation of divine magic that could not be undone by mere mortals.


The people of Kanchi lived in the shadow of these walls, their lives intertwined with the myths and legends of their city's origins. They believed that as long as the walls stood, the old gods' protection would endure, shielding them from the ravages of time and the ambitions of mortal men. This belief gave them a sense of invincibility, a conviction that no force on earth could breach their sanctuary.

Varadharaj, however, saw the walls not as an insurmountable barrier but as a challenge to his destiny. He was determined to prove that even the mightiest of fortifications could fall before his strategic genius and the prophecy that he believed marked him as the chosen one. His siege was a testament to his unyielding ambition, a desire to carve his name into the annals of history by conquering the unconquerable.

As he stood on the outskirts of Kanchi, watching the city's formidable defenses, Varadharaj felt a surge of destiny. He knew that taking Kanchi would be more than just a military victory; it would be a triumph over the legends and myths that had kept the city invincible for centuries. It would be the ultimate proof of his prowess and the fulfillment of the prophecy that drove him.
