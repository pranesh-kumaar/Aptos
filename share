“Since none of my own were available to lit the pyre, she did it. Her.” …… “Irrespective of which, The pyre burned bright – bright enough to touch the far side of river, they said. And even there a blue swan on the river, that night. Like it was the Sholiyar, that come to pay the respect to the stallion. And I—I haven’t even figured out how to mourn him.”
