She wasn’t naive. The realm wouldn’t speak of him as a loving brother.

Ambitious? Certainly. That part of him had always been there—quiet at first, then sharpening over the years. But love? That was harder to define.

Still, in his own way, he had done more for her than most brothers ever would. He had fought for her future—sometimes in silence, sometimes through fire.

He loved her. Of that, she was certain. But love didn’t always arrive wrapped in warmth or affection. Sometimes, it came cloaked in politics. Sometimes, it was laced with strategy and the bitter taste of sacrifice.

He had revolted against his own brother—toppled family ties—to ensure she married the Mudhaliyar. Maybe it was out of loyalty. Maybe he believed she deserved the title and the life. Or maybe… it was for himself. A way to draw closer to the Mudhaliyar, the man whose name was still passed around like a loaded secret in every corridor of power.

She would never know for sure.

But in this realm, love was rarely pure. And never simple.
