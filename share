"My two sons aren't here when I need them. One has been exiled, while the other is lost in duty far from home and even further from the duty he must endure. And the girl I call daughter will carry our name forward. You, my kin, should have stood by me — yet you bring me no peace or comfort, only schemes and plans."
“I didn’t see you in the funeral. Nor once while the pyre burned for eight long nights. So where were you?”
“I didn’t want to be gone. But you know my duties —  as Mudhaliyar, and to the realm. I was doing what was asked of me.” ……….. I regret not being by your side. But I had to serve – especially now, with no Mudhaliyar in the South. But I’m here now, Maitri. Tell me —  how are you holding up ? How was the funeral ?”
