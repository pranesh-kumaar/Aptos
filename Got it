QUEEN (quietly):
Eight days. That’s all it took for the fire to go out of this house.
He burned so bright, didn’t he, anna? So stubborn, so damn certain — even when he was wrong. Especially when he was wrong.

(pause, breath catches slightly)
I never questioned him. Not when he marched against my father’s wishes to marry me. Not when he took a spear in the shoulder for a village boy he didn’t know.
And not even when he brought her home.

(a slow scoff, half-laugh)
Vaidehi. A child. Hair like mine, but eyes like some prophecy.
He said nothing — just placed her into the nursery.
And like a fool, I said nothing too.
Because she was a girl. Because I trusted him.
Because I thought no child — especially not a girl — could ever come between what I bore and what he built.

(voice hardens)
My sons — our sons — shared her rice, her toys, her tutors.
They loved her like blood. Called her akka. Even my youngest, my gentle boy…
And I let it be.
I told myself: She is no threat. She is a girl. She is not his own.

(rises, paces slightly)
But blood tells. Doesn’t it?
He didn’t just raise her. He chose her.
Over his own sons.
Over me.

(she turns to her brother, eyes glinting)
Do you know what it does to a woman — a queen — to be told she’s good enough to sit beside a throne, but not to shape what comes after it?
Do you know what it does to a mother to see her sons looked at with pity, while she — Vaidehi — is hailed as destiny?

(beat. quieter)
I fought him. I screamed. I asked him how he could betray me, betray us.
He said nothing at first.
Then he said:
“Because she is the South.”
As if my womb bore clouds, and hers bore rain.

(a long pause. Her voice drops)
Then he sent my second son away. Cast him out. For a drunken fight.
For one mistake.
And yet she — this perfect daughter of destiny — remained untouched.

(trembling now)
He died still believing in her.
And now they say the South will obey his will. That she will be crowned Mudhaliyar today.
That I, the queen of this house, will bow to a girl I did not birth.
That my sons will kneel.
That his virtues live on through her.

(turns to her brother fully, almost begging)
Tell me, anna…
Was I ever his queen?
Or just the woman he needed until the girl he wanted could grow up?

(she walks to the window, looking out toward the gathering outside)
Eight days.
And today, the drums sound for her.

(final line, soft and bitter)
Even in death… he wins.
